// super basic mongo cli commands, cuz I always forget this shit

mongo  // start shell
show dbs   // list dbs
use rn-dev // typically this one
show collections
db.sets.find()              // or
db['sample-blobs'].find()   // this

db['sample-blobs'].drop()   // deletes entire collection with no confirmation ;)

// also don't forget to switch on mongoose debugging at config if needed.

- I think something is fucked up between mongoose/mongodb/bson, maybe installed it wrong somehow?
  - basically I "solved" this with:
    'cd node_modules/mongoose/node_modules/mongodb ; npm install'
  - either I fucked up somewhere installing mongo, or this is a fucked up dependency within mongo.
  - some similar reports:
